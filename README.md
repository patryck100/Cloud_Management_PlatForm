# Cloud_Managment_PlatForm
 This is a Distributed Systems project which will be done on IDE Eclipse, the goal of this project is to Simulate a Management Cloud Environment which has the main functionalities needed for a successful cloud environment such as Visibility and Control. The Visibility aspect will be safely handle by a Login application, which allows the user to access their data. The user will also be able to Control their data by adding, removing, printing or even changing the size of their Cloud. First a Protocol Buffer is generated in order to build a gRPC code. The Requests and Responses will be later handle by the gRPC through microservices which finally will be requested by the Clients.
